# Purpose

Student Council is LASA’s student government organization, made up of four elected officers from each class. Officers serve as the community and social chairs of the school – acting as class organizers, student advocates, morale officers, and major project planners among many other duties and responsibilities.

# Organization of Website
Updates about current student council activities will be posted in the "announcement" sections. You can find all announcements made to classes in the "Remind Feeds" section. This section will be more holistic, while the "announcements" section will be more organized, and sometimes more thorough on important events.
