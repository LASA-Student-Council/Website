There are a lot of designs, but we wanted you to scroll through all of them before voting. Some designs aren't placed on a t-shirt yet (they're just designs), so if you have any suggestions on placement for those designs, they are welcome on the form at the end. Remember that although we read all of your feedback and look at your votes in depth (anonymous, by the way), we will make a decision not only on voting but what we think will sell best.
