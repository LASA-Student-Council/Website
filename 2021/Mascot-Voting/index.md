There are a lot of designs, but we wanted you to scroll through all of them before voting. Some designs aren't placed on a t-shirt yet (they're just designs), so if you have any suggestions on placement for those designs, they are welcome on the form at the end. Remember that although we read all of your feedback and look at your votes in depth (anonymous, by the way), we will make a decision not only on voting but what we think will sell best.

**When voting it is important that you consider the design, not the current appearance. Some designs aren't embedded on a t-shirt, but try to imagine these on a t-shirt when voting for them (in any position, really). We may in the end combine elements of certain designs. If you have comments on the placement of certain design elements, you can make them at the end of the form.**
