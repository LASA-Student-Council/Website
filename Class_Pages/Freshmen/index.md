# Hello Freshmen!
This is the Freshmen’s section of the class website. We’ll be posting announcements and future events on this page! Below, you can find some links to some class wide resources!

## Remind
To receive text alerts about events concerning the freshman class, join our remind by clicking this link: <https://www.remind.com/join/lasa2023>, or you can text @lasa2023 to 81010 This is the best and quickest way for you to get updates for social events, StuCo reminders, and also just general updates about LASA (not necessarily just stuco events).

## Instagram
Another great way to get information is through Instagram. If you have one, follow @LASAClassof2023 to stay updated and connect with events happening around the school. 

## Contact
The best way for you to get in touch with us is through DMing us on Instagram or contacting us via the Remind. Our personal emails are also listed on the “Current Officers” page.
