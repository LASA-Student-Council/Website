<p>Hello Juniors and Seniors!</p>

<p>After some deliberation, the student councils of both LBJ and LASA have decided to move forward with a <strong>virtual prom</strong>. The event will consist of a Zoom meetup, where attendees will be separated out into a music breakout room of their choice, all with a DJ and different music genres.</p>

<p>Similarly, the week leading up to virtual prom will be a <strong>spirit week</strong>. Different theme contests will be held each day of the week. Voting for those contests will take place and be announced at virtual prom, along with the announcement of <strong>Prom Royalty</strong>. More details about what exactly those contests will look like will be released soon.</p>

<p>This event is <strong>by no means mandatory</strong>, but instead a free, fun event that any junior or senior can participate in. We understand that this cannot act as a full replacement for prom—but rather, something exciting for anyone who wants to attend.</p>

<p>On that note, we need some help in order to make this happen! If you are interested in acting as a <strong>DJ for one of the rooms</strong>, please fill out this google form: <a href="https://forms.gle/ckvd8pq4uiKFvYDU6">https://forms.gle/ckvd8pq4uiKFvYDU6</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not planning on attending virtual prom, we will be trying to host <strong>other social grade-wide activities soon</strong>. Please fill out this google form to let us know what you all may want to do (examples include <strong>Minecraft</strong>, skribbl.io, and other non-serious activities): <a href="https://forms.gle/jsQmVufzByBLPNNb6">https://forms.gle/jsQmVufzByBLPNNb6</a>.</p>

<p>Please let us know if you have any questions. Thank you all for being so patient &amp; helpful as we have been trying to figure this situation out!</p>
