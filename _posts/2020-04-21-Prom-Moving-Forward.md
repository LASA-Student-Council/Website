Hello Juniors and Seniors!

After some deliberation, the student councils of both LBJ and LASA have decided to move forward with a **virtual prom**. The event will consist of a Zoom meetup, where attendees will be separated out into a music breakout room of their choice, all with a DJ and different music genres. 

Similarly, the week leading up to virtual prom will be a **spirit week**. Different theme contests will be held each day of the week. Voting for those contests will take place and be announced at virtual prom, along with the announcement of **Prom Royalty**. More details about what exactly those contests will look like will be released soon. 

This event is **by no means mandatory**, but instead a free, fun event that any junior or senior can participate in. We understand that this cannot act as a full replacement for promâ€”but rather, something exciting for anyone who wants to attend. 

On that note, we need some help in order to make this happen! If you are interested in acting as a **DJ for one of the rooms**, please fill out this google form: <https://forms.gle/ckvd8pq4uiKFvYDU6>.

If you are not planning on attending virtual prom, we will be trying to host **other social grade-wide activities soon**. Please fill out this google form to let us know what you all may want to do (examples include **Minecraft**, skribbl.io, and other non-serious activities): <https://forms.gle/jsQmVufzByBLPNNb6>.

Please let us know if you have any questions. Thank you all for being so patient & helpful as we have been trying to figure this situation out!
