- There will be a "reveal" on Friday of the Athlete's identities

# Scavenger Hunt (Kind of)
- Each day, Student Council will post an item or photo you need to find or take.
- Each time you "find the item," you will be entered into a drawing to win a prize
- The winner of the drawing will be announced on Friday
