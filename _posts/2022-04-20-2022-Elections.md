If you're interested in running for Student Council this year, please read the instructions on [this document](https://lasastuco.com/images/2022ElectionRules.pdf) very closely.

Update (4/27): Due to the current teacher shortage and this year's change to nine week grading periods, the grade requirement for running has been changed to 80s or above for last semester's averages.

# Important Tips
- Make sure your classmates' initials are legible - your peers should write their name in print (not signature) and initial.
