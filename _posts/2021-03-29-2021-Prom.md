**Update 4/5: Per a new AISD policy, only seniors are allowed at prom. There is now just one time: 7:00 to 11:00 pm.**

**Update 3/31: The timeline for ticket sales has been extended and a reduced early ticket price added.**

LASA and LBJ Student Councils are excited to announce that prom will be on April 24th in-person at LASA/LBJ (specifically, in the front of the school). The theme is _Alice in Wonderland_.

Ticket sales will be open from April 5th until April 23rd. Tickets will cost $20 through April 18th. After April 18th, tickets will cost $25. Tickets can be bought here: https://bit.ly/39RF9tq

# How to buy Tickets
To currently buy tickets, you need to register a school cash online and link it to a current LASA senior. Then, the prom event will show up on the main page of school cash online. We are currently working with the district so that the link is available without registering for an account, but this is not available at the moment.

# More information

Some people wanted there to be dancing, so we will have a dance area, but because we thought it would be hard for most people to dance apart from one another, the focus on prom will be on socialization. After all, this will probably be the first time in a while you are seeing many of your classmates in-person! We will also have various forms of entertainment, such as caricature artists, a photography area, and various games, to keep you entertained. Light snacks and drinks will be provided.

To address some safety concerns: the event will be held completely outside. Participants will be required to not congregate in groups larger than 10 people. All participants will wear masks and hand-sanitizer will be available throughout the event.

To give you an idea of what this is generally going to look like, here's a draft layout:
