**Update 3/31: The timeline for ticket sales has been extended and a reduced early ticket price added.**

LASA and LBJ Student Councils are excited to announce that prom will be on April 24th in-person at LASA/LBJ (specifically, in the front of the school). The theme is _Alice in Wonderland_.

So that people can effectively social distance, we will have two times: 6:30 to 8:30 pm and 9:00 to 11:00 pm. You can pick which time you are signing up for when registering for the event.

**Ticket sales will be open from April 5th until April 22nd.** Tickets will cost $20 through April 16th. After April 16th, tickets will cost $25.

Some people wanted there to be dancing, so we will have a dance area, but because we thought it would be hard for most people to dance apart from one another, the focus on prom will be on socialization. After all, this will probably be the first time in a while you are seeing many of your classmates in-person! We will also have various forms of entertainment, such as caricature artists, a photography area, and various games, to keep you entertained. Light snacks and drinks will be provided.

To address some safety concerns: the event will be held completely outside. Participants will be required to not congregate in groups larger than 10 people. All participants will wear masks and hand-sanitizer will be available throughout the event.

To give you an idea of what this is generally going to look like, here's a draft layout:
