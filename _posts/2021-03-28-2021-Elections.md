To be on the ballot for Student Council, you must be a student in good standing (all grades above an 80 for the year and no strikes/referrals).


As part of your application, you will need to submit your grades. This part of the application is not on the google form. Rather, you will email them to melissa.driscoll@austinisd.org. This is explained in the handout and google form below.

Once you submit your application, you are welcome to start working on your video/written statement, however we will hold a mandatory Q&A session on these statements later on.
