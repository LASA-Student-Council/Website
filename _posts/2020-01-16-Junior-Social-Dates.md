Hey Juniors! We've decided the dates for our junior socials this semester (and for the rest of the school year).

## Dates
The dates are **February 7th** and **April 3rd**.

## Important information
- All socials will be during lunch at the end of the math hallway
- ONLY FOR JUNIORS
- Although never 100% guaranteed, there will probably be enough for some people to have seconds (we will send out a remind if this is true on the date of).


Thanks!
-- Your junior student council
