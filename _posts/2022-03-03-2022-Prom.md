# FAQs
**Where is prom?**
This year's prom is held at the Sheraton Austin Hotel at the Capitol (701 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78701).

**What do I need to bring?**
If you purchased your ticket online, you should bring a receipt (email or print). A school ID will also be required for entrance.

**Will dinner be provided?**
Please eat a full meal before prom. Dinner will not be served, but there will be light refreshments provided throughout the evening.

**When is the latest time I can arrive?**
Doors will close at 11pm, so please plan to arrive before then. Additionally, reentry is not permitted (i.e., you cannot leave prom and come back later).

**How can I get my ticket if I paid online?**
You won't need a physical ticket for entry as long as you bring a receipt. Physical "souvenir" tickets will be given when checking in.

**What if I'm bringing someone not from LASA?**
If you'd like to bring a non-LASA student, they should have already completed and turned in the form above to Mr. Paulson. Please have them also bring an ID.

There is a parking garage and parking spots will be provided for free.
