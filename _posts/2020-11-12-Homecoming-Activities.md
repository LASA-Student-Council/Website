Although there is no Homecoming Dance this year, Student Council is still planning some activities to celebrate this week.

# Guess the Student/Teacher/Athlete
- One Student, student athlete, and teacher's interests/hobbies will be posted on the Student Council Instagram per day.
- You are encouraged to guess the identity of these individuals
- There will be a "reveal" on Friday of their identities

# Scavenger Hunt (Kind of)
- Each day, Student Council will post two items or photos you need to find or take.
- Each time you "find the two items," you will be entered into a drawing to win a prize
- The winner(s) of the drawing will be announced on Friday

# Theme days
Be creative with these days! Virtual backgrounds are encouraged as well for each day.
- Monday: Animal Day
- Tuesday: Cowboy Day 
- Wednesday: Under the Sea Day 
- Thursday: Meme Day
- Friday: Spirit Day
