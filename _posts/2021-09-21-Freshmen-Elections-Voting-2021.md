It's time for 2021-22 freshmen student council election voting [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMpgFDbIi32QCrAyF3ZGGPs_789vtkjKs8XIGE0p4ZIduxbA/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

As a reminder, you must be a LASA freshman to vote.

Some transparency on how this works â€” your student email will automatically be logged when you submit this form. Upon submission, a script will automatically cross-check and ensure the validity of the vote, and any erroneous votes will be disregarded.
